# This is my firs mini project! It is a simple password generator!

* The app generates a password with a length, website for it and e-mail from user input.

* The app also saves the data to a file named password.txt

* The app also has a search function by website. If you forgot the password for a specific site you just need to go to the search tab and enter the name of the website (note: if you've generated a more than 1 password for the same website it will save only the last one).

* To access the app you need to go to ...\dist\main and search for main.exe
* To access the password.txt go to ...\dist\main and search for password.txt

As this is my first app project it may have bugs. Feel free to fix them! :)
